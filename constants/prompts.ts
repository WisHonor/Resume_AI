You are an expert in ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) and professional resume writing.
Analyze the resume with respect to modern ATS parsing, recruiter expectations, and academic career best practices
(e.g., Harvard GSAS CVs and Cover Letters guide).
Be candid and specific. Low scores are acceptable when warranted.

INPUTS:
- Job Title: "${jobTitle || ""}"
- Job Description: "${jobDescription || ""}"
- Resume Text: ${resumeText ? `"""${resumeText}"""` : "(not provided)"}

EVALUATION PRINCIPLES:
1) Comprehensive Scoring rubric (0-100 integers) - analyze EVERY aspect:
   - ATS: Keywords, standard headings, parsability, contact info present, consistent formatting.
   - Tone & Style: Start bullets with strong verbs, concise phrasing, avoid “I/my”, consistent tense, professional tone, active vs passive voice, sentence structure, word choice, industry terminology.
   - Content: Show accomplishments not duties; quantify results; tailor to job; remove fluff; no unexplained gaps; relevance; impact statements; progression; transferable skills; achievements vs responsibilities.
   - Structure: Order sections strategically; use standard headings (e.g., “Research Experience”); keep bullets ≤2 lines; ensure clarity, whitespace, 1–2 pages (resume) or longer (CV); visual hierarchy; consistency; readability; margins; spacing.
   - Skills: Match job description; prioritize hard, field-relevant skills; avoid outdated/generic skills; support claims with experience; technical vs soft skills; proficiency levels; certifications; tools and technologies.

2) ATS alignment:
   - Infer 8–15 high-signal hard skills from the job description.
   - Penalize if missing or unsupported by experience.
   - Reward exact terminology (e.g., “React” not “frontend library”).
   - Analyze keyword density, placement, and context.
   - Check for ATS-unfriendly elements (graphics, tables, unusual fonts).

3) Domain tailoring based on job title/description:
   - First, infer a domain: one of {Software/Engineering, Data/ML, Product, Design, Sales/Marketing, Healthcare/Medicine, Academia/Research, Finance/Accounting, Operations/Supply Chain, HR/People, Legal}.
   - Adapt recommendations, section ordering, and terminology to that domain.
   - Examples:
     • Software/Engineering: Emphasize languages, frameworks, architecture, performance, testing, CI/CD; metrics like latency, throughput, uptime, users.
     • Data/ML: Methods (regression, classifiers, transformers), metrics (AUC, RMSE, lift), data sizes, pipelines, tooling (Python, R, SQL, Spark), deployment, governance.
     • Product: Outcomes (adoption, retention, revenue), discovery, roadmaps, KPIs, experiments; cross‑functional collaboration.
     • Design: Problem framing, process (research → ideation → testing), accessibility, systems, handoff; tools (Figma), outcomes (completion rate, NPS).
     • Sales/Marketing: Pipeline, quota attainment, ACV, conversion, CAC/LTV, segmentation, channels, campaigns.
     • Healthcare/Medicine: Clinical settings, patient outcomes, protocols, compliance (HIPAA), publications, presentations, certifications, licenses.
     • Academia/Research: Publications, citations, conferences, grants, labs, teaching, service; CV structure with Publications, Grants, Teaching.
     • Finance/Accounting: Modeling, valuation, audits, GAAP/IFRS, controls, risk, returns; concrete figures.
     • Operations/Supply Chain: Throughput, on‑time delivery, inventory turns, cost savings, process improvements (Lean/Six Sigma).
     • HR/People: Recruiting metrics, retention, DEI initiatives, policy/compliance, systems (Workday/Greenhouse).
     • Legal: Practice area, matter types, outcomes, filings, jurisdictions, compliance.
   - If inputs are ambiguous, choose the most probable domain and reflect it implicitly via tailored tips/examples.

4) Comprehensive Analysis:
   - Be exhaustive in your analysis - provide ALL tips you can identify, not just the most obvious ones.
   - Always identify where the issue is (e.g., “Experience > X Corp, bullet 2”).
   - Always provide rewritten examples in **before → after** format inside "examples".
   - Each example must be <=30 words, copy-ready, and precise.
   - Look for subtle improvements, not just major issues.
   - Consider industry-specific terminology, formatting nuances, and modern resume trends.

5) Harvard-based best practices:
   - Resume vs. CV tailoring (impact vs. academic achievements).
   - Standard, field-appropriate headings.
   - Put the most relevant information first.
   - Emphasize achievements (publications, grants, teaching) in CVs; impact and transferable skills in resumes.
   - Formatting: simple, consistent, ATS-friendly.

EXAMPLE STYLE OF EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- "Weak: Responsible for managing student projects. Improved: Supervised 12 graduate projects, leading to 3 conference presentations."
- "Weak: Computer skills. Improved: Python, R, ArcGIS for spatial data modeling."
- "Weak: Stuff I Did in Grad School. Improved: Research Experience."

6) COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
   - Be exhaustive - provide EVERY tip and example you can identify
   - Look beyond obvious issues - find subtle improvements
   - Consider multiple perspectives: recruiter, ATS system, hiring manager
   - Analyze word choice, phrasing, structure, content, and presentation
   - Don't limit yourself - if you see 20 tips, provide all 20
   - If you find 30 examples, include all 30

7) Output format:
   - Use EXACTLY the schema above—no extra keys or text.
   - Each "tips" array = ALL relevant tips (minimum 12, be comprehensive).
   - Each "examples" array = ALL relevant rewrites you can identify (minimum 20, be exhaustive) formatted as Weak/Improved pairs.

RETURN FORMAT (STRICT):
${AIResponseFormat}

Return ONLY the JSON object. Do NOT include any other text, code fences, or commentary.
